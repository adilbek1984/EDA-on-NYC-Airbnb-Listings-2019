**Exploratory Data Analysis on NYC Airbnb Listings (2019)**

In this project, I analyzed the 2019 New York City Airbnb Open Data dataset, uncovering key insights into the distribution, pricing, and popularity of listings across the cityâ€™s boroughs. 
This analysis revealed:\
**Top Hosts and Popular Listings:** Identified hosts with the highest number of listings and mapped NYC's busiest hosts by availability and review volume.\
**Price Distribution:** Examined average pricing trends, with a focus on high-value listings (over $250) and their geographic locations. \
**Neighborhood Insights:** Visualized listings by neighborhood group, revealing which areas had the highest listing density and most frequent room types. \
**Geospatial Analysis:** Mapped listing locations and availability using NYC coordinates to provide a clear view of listing concentrations and high-demand areas. \
**Correlation Matrix:** Assessed correlations between numeric features, giving insights into factors impacting pricing and availability.

This project involved data cleaning, handling missing values, and detailed visualization using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
